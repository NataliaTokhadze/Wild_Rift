# Wild Rift Champions Search

This is a Django web application for searching champions from the game **Wild Rift**.  
Users can search champions by name and instantly see their role, as well as who they are strong or weak against.  

The main page features a clean interface with a search field, and the backend provides a fast API for champion lookup.  
The project also includes Django admin for easy management of the champions database.
